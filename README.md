# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms with NumPy

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning and deep learning algorithms using NumPy. Unlike typical implementations that rely on library APIs, the focus here is on understanding the basic principles and implementations of algorithms. At the moment, training aspects are not covered, and the code may not be necessarily rigorous or efficient; it is intended solely for learning and reference purposes.

**Python Version**: 3.9

**NumPy Version**: 1.22
